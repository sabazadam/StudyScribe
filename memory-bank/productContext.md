# Product Context: StudyScribe

## Why This Project Exists

### The Problem
Students face several time-consuming challenges in their study process:

1. **Lecture Processing**: Hours of recorded lectures need to be reviewed and summarized manually
2. **Poor Note Quality**: Whiteboard photos and handwritten notes are often blurry, illegible, or hard to reference
3. **Inefficient Study**: Students spend more time organizing materials than actually studying
4. **Lost Time**: Manual transcription and summarization takes hours away from learning

### The Solution
StudyScribe automates the transformation of raw learning materials into structured, high-quality study aids using AI, allowing students to focus on actual learning rather than administrative tasks.

## How It Should Work

### User Journey 1: Lecture Processing
1. Student records or obtains lecture audio/video
2. Uploads file to StudyScribe (drag & drop or browse)
3. Selects desired outputs:
   - Brief summary for quick review
   - Detailed concepts for deep understanding
   - Practice quiz for self-assessment
4. AI processes the lecture (transcription → analysis → generation)
5. Receives consolidated PDF with all selected sections
6. PDF automatically saved to Study Hub
7. Can download, share, or review anytime

### User Journey 2: Whiteboard Enhancement
1. Student takes photo of whiteboard or handwritten notes
2. Uploads image to StudyScribe
3. AI enhances the image (contrast, sharpness, clarity)
4. AI extracts text via OCR
5. See before/after comparison
6. Copy extracted text for digital notes
7. Save enhanced image to Study Hub

### User Journey 3: Study Hub Management
1. Access personal library of all materials
2. Search by name, date, or course
3. Filter by type (lecture guides vs. images)
4. Download materials for offline study
5. Rename for better organization
6. Delete outdated materials

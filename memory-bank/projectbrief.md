# Project Brief: StudyScribe

## Project Overview
StudyScribe is an AI-powered study assistant web application that helps students save time and improve study efficiency by transforming lecture materials into structured study aids.

## Core Vision
To be the go-to platform for students to convert raw lecture content (audio/video recordings and whiteboard photos) into high-quality, actionable study materials using AI.

## Target Users
- University and college students
- High school students
- Online learners
- Anyone who attends lectures or takes notes

## Project Goals
1. **Primary Goal**: Create a functional web application with UI and basic backend demo for class presentation (4-week timeline)
2. **Future Goals**: Add user authentication, payment/subscription system, full AI integration, cloud storage

## Core Features

### 1. AI Lecture-to-Study-Guide Generator
- Upload audio/video files (.mp3, .mp4, .wav, .mov)
- Customizable output options:
  - Brief Summary
  - Detailed Concepts
  - Practice Quiz
- Generate consolidated PDF with selected sections
- Save to personal library

### 2. Whiteboard & Note Enhancer
- Upload photos of whiteboards/handwritten notes
- AI-powered image enhancement (clarity, contrast, sharpness)
- OCR text extraction
- Before/after comparison view
- Copyable extracted text
- Save to library

### 3. Study Hub (Personal Library)
- Cloud-based storage for all generated materials
- Search and filter functionality
- Organize study guides and enhanced images
- Download and rename capabilities
- Delete management

## Technical Requirements
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 (React), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Next.js API Routes, Node.js
- **AI Services**: Google Gemini (primary), Google Vision API (images), potentially Claude/GPT for PDF generation
- **Deployment**: Vercel
- **Initial Scope**: No authentication (add later)
- **Timeline**: 4 weeks total, functional UI needed by Week 1

## Success Criteria (MVP)
1. ✅ Working UI for all 4 main pages
2. ✅ File upload functionality
3. ✅ Mock AI processing demonstration
4. ✅ Unified, professional design system
5. ✅ Smooth navigation and user flows
6. ✅ Ready for live demo presentation

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)
- User authentication and accounts
- Subscription/payment integration
- Full AI integration (Gemini, Vision API)
- Cloud storage (Firebase, AWS S3)
- Collaboration features
- Mobile app
- Advanced quiz types
- Study analytics

## Project Context
- **Purpose**: Class project + startup validation
- **Timeline**: 4 weeks for MVP
- **Presentation**: Tomorrow (need functional UI + basic backend)
- **Personal Goal**: Test ability to create production-quality projects

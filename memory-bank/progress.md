- Support ticket volume

## Evolution of Decisions

### Decision Log

#### October 19, 2024: Project Initialization
- **Framework Choice**: Selected Next.js 14 over separate React + Express
  - *Reason*: Faster development, built-in API routes, better Vercel integration

- **Design Unification**: Decided to unify designs immediately instead of later
  - *Reason*: Easier to build once correctly than to refactor later

- **MVP Scope**: Decided on UI + Basic Backend for presentation
  - *Reason*: Balance between impressive demo and achievable timeline

- **No Authentication Initially**: Postponed auth to post-MVP
  - *Reason*: Focus on core functionality first, add user system later

- **Mock AI Responses**: Using fake/sample AI outputs for MVP
  - *Reason*: No API keys yet, focus on UI/UX, integrate real AI later

## Success Criteria

### MVP Success (Week 1 - Tomorrow)
- [x] Memory Bank complete
- [ ] All pages functional and navigable
- [ ] File upload working
- [ ] Mock processing demonstrable
- [ ] Professional, unified design
- [ ] Ready for live presentation

### Week 4 Success (Full MVP)
- [ ] Real AI integration (Gemini + Vision)
- [ ] Cloud storage working
- [ ] Full processing pipeline
- [ ] Polished UI/UX
- [ ] Deployed to Vercel
- [ ] Shareable demo link

### Future Success (6 Months)
- [ ] 100+ active users
- [ ] User authentication live
- [ ] Payment system functional
- [ ] Positive user feedback
- [ ] Revenue generating
- [ ] Sustainable operation

## Notes

### What's Going Well
- Clear project vision
- Comprehensive planning
- Realistic scope for timeline
- Good technical foundation

### What Could Be Better
- Need to work fast for tomorrow's deadline
- No design team (relying on provided HTML)
- Solo development (no code review)

### Lessons Learned
- Memory Bank system is excellent for project clarity
- Planning before coding saves time
- Clear scope prevents feature creep
- Mock data is essential for demos
